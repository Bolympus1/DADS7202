# DADS7202 Hello World
# Traditional ML vs MLP
## 1. Dataset
diabetes _ binary _ health _ indicators _ BRFSS2015.csv is a clean dataset of 253,680 survey responses to the CDC's BRFSS2015. The target variable Diabetes_binary has 2 classes. 0 is for no diabetes, and 1 is for prediabetes or diabetes. This dataset has 21 feature variables and is not balanced.
Explore some of the following research questions:

  1.Can survey questions from the BRFSS provide accurate predictions of whether an individual has diabetes?
  2.What risk factors are most predictive of diabetes risk?
  3.Can we use a subset of the risk factors to accurately predict whether an individual has diabetes?
  4.Can we create a short form of questions from the BRFSS using feature selection to accurately predict if someone might have diabetes or is at high risk of diabetes?

# Introduction: 
This project aim to study the performance of machine learning algorithm between traditional ML and Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) with data set "diabetes _ binary _ health _ indicators". The task is Binary classification which is evaluate model performane by F1-score.

# Assumption:
As the dataset quite big 253,680 survey and has 21 feature variables with not balanced betwwen diabetes and non-diabetes, our assumption is MLP should show the high performance than traditional ML.
